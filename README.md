Unsupervised Spectral Satellite Image Analysis for Classification of Crop Types
Satellite imagery has emerged as a valuable resource for monitoring and classifying land cover, particularly in precision agriculture. This work explores the field of unsupervised spectral analysis of Sentinel-1 satellite data for crop-type classification. Using the special properties of Sentinel-1's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Sentinel-1 data provides a strong basis for agricultural surveillance because of its capacity to see through cloud cover and provide all-weather imagery.
These findings show how well unsupervised spectral analysis can distinguish different crop kinds in the German environment. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in capturing the nuances of agricultural land cover. I used Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) and k-means clustering, two unsupervised clustering methods. By expanding the use of unsupervised spectral satellite image analysis in precision agriculture, the knowledge obtained from this work opens the door to more precise and effective crop monitoring techniques.
